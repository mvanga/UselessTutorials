### general rules for git
How should a collaboration between people in a big project look like? (branches, who merges, patches/pushing)
Using branches (and not introducing changes to the main branch)

### cases
#Extreme
Amend fucked me over: what should I do? Authorship is fucked too!
Accidentally I commited changes to master branch. How to move it to my branch? 

#Easy
I added several commits and now I that in one of them a bug has been introduced. How to find it? (bisect)
I made a commit and now I see it is incomplete. 
Add a commit between two commits
Reword the commit message of a past commit
Adding changes to the last commit (using git stash)

#Trivial
I found a few lines that seem to be particularly stupid. Who is the author?
